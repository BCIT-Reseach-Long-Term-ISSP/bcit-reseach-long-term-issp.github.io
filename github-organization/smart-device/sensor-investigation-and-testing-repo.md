**Name:** sensor-investigation-and-testing

**Link:** [https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/sensor-investigation-and-testing](https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/sensor-investigation-and-testing)

This repository contains all the sensor sample code, library stripped sample code, testing code, and calibration code.

This repository was used when first investigating a sensor, how it works, and creating the conversion / calibration functions without the use of libraries.
