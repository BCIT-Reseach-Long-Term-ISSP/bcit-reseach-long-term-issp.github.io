# iot-dashboard-2023-backend Repository

**Name:** iot-dashboard-2023-backend

**Status:** <span style="color:green">Active</span>, Hosted

**Link:** [https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/iot-dashboard-2023-backend](https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/iot-dashboard-2023-backend)

**Hosted Link:** [https://iot-dashboard-backend-server.onrender.com/](https://iot-dashboard-backend-server.onrender.com/)

**NOTE:** The backend is hosted on a free tier with Render.com. When you make the very first server request (for example an initial log-in), please expect about a 4-5 minute server start up time. During this time, the page may not be responsive. Once the server is up and running, everything else should be quick! It's unfortunate, but it's how it has to be for us to keep this project free.
