# react-bootstrap-icons

react-bootstrap-icons is a suite of components which correspond to icons found in Bootstrap Icons. The GitHub repository for it can be found [here](https://github.com/ismamz/react-bootstrap-icons), and the full list of Bootstrap Icons can be found [here](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

Every component in this suite takes the same props. Below are the props which are used in pages of the dashboard; please note that there may be more props that are unlisted here due to not being used on the dashboard.

**Props used:**
- *size*: A number which determines the size of the icon.
- *color*: A string which determines the color of the icon. This may be a hex value or a word (depending on if the word is recognized as a colour).
- *style*: An object which determines the styling of the icon; the object is governed by the same rules as a regular React object's style prop.
