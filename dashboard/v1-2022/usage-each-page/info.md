# Getting Started / Setup 

This section contains information about how to use the dashboard to see information.

To begin, we must first visit our hosted webapp by clicking on [this link.](https://bcitema-f85bf.web.app/)

Here you will be greeted by the map page, and instructions on navigating this page can be found [here.](https://bcit-reseach-long-term-issp.github.io/docs/dashboard/user-manual/map)

Instructions for navigating the device information page can be found [here.](https://bcit-reseach-long-term-issp.github.io/docs/dashboard/user-manual/info)

## Viewing Device and Sensor Statistics

**1.** Click on the device statistic button (middle button) in the navbar.

Here, we can view a general statistic overview of all the sensors on a particular device. The statistics/measurements displayed are all from the latest timestamped data recording.

Furthermore, we can view the device's location on the map by looking at the widget on the top right of the page.

Below this Widget, we can also view weather info in the YVR area, tide schedule, and device ID and battery level.

**2.** Click on any one of the several tabs at the top of the window to view a detailed graph view of a specific sensor.

Here, we can view a specific sensor's data readings over a specified range of time, and we can read the current, maximum, minimum, and average readings in the specified range of time.

![Device Info Graph](https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/bcit-reseach-long-term-issp.github.io/blob/master/dashboard/assets/DeviceInfoGraph.png?raw=true "Device Info Graph")

We can also look at this information in table format.
