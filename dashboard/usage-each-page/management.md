# Getting Started 

This section contains information about how to use the device management/notifications page of the dashboard to modify device thresholds and locations.

**1.** Click on the bell icon button (right button) in the navbar.

Here, you will be greeted by the account page and you can choose to log in. If you do not log in with an admin account, you can only view warnings of the devices, and attempt to edit device information. If you attempt to edit device information however, the changes you try to apply will not be saved.

If wondering how to view device warnings only, skip this section by clicking [here.](#viewing-device-warnings)

**2.** Click on "Log In"

**3.** Log in with a corresponding Google account. 

If the account is not an admin, this is what the page should look like:
