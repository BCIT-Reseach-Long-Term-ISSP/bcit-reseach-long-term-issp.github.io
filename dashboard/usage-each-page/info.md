# Getting Started 

This section contains information about how to use the device information page of the dashboard to see information.

## Viewing Device and Sensor Statistics

**1.** Click on the device statistic button (middle button) in the navbar.

Here, we can view a general statistic overview of all the sensors on a particular device. The statistics/measurements displayed are all from the latest timestamped data recording.

Furthermore, we can view the device's location on the map by looking at the widget on the top right of the page.

![Map Widget Zoomed](https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/bcit-reseach-long-term-issp.github.io/blob/master/dashboard/assets/MapWidgetZoom.png?raw=true "Map Widget Zoomed")

Below this Widget, we can also view weather info in the YVR area, tide schedule, and device ID and battery level.

**2.** Click on any one of the several tabs at the top of the window to view a detailed graph view of a specific sensor.

**3.** Click on "select time frame" and a dropdown list should show. Click on any one of these options. For this example, we'll use "This Month".

Here, we can view a specific sensor's data readings over a specified range of time, and we can read the current, maximum, minimum, and average readings in the specified range of time.

![Device Info Graph](https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/bcit-reseach-long-term-issp.github.io/blob/master/dashboard/assets/DeviceInfoGraph.png?raw=true "Device Info Graph")

We can also look at this information in table format.

![Device Info Table](https://github.com/BCIT-Reseach-Long-Term-ISSP/bcit-reseach-long-term-issp.github.io/blob/master/dashboard/assets/DeviceInfoTable.PNG?raw=true "Device Info Table")

Finally, we can export and download this data as well by clicking on "Download Data"
