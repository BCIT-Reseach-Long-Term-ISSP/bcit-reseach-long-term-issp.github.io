# Tech Stack & Bookmarks
Last updated: May 1, 2023 3:02 PM


## Tech Stack Overview


| ðŸ’¡ The oldest version of Node.js you can be on is **16.13.2** â€” newer versions are fine. If youâ€™re on an older version (e.g. before 16.13.2) we recommend you **reinstall or upgrade Node.**

ðŸ’¡ The TypeScript version ****weâ€™re using is **4.9.5.** Please **DO NOT** use 5.0.4, it will **break the project for you locally!** |

The **YVR Dashboard** is built with the MERN stack (**MongoDB, Express, React, Node**) in the **TypeScript** language. The server runs on Node/Express/Mongo while the client uses React as a framework, and **Chakra** as the main UI library. **Recoil** is also used alongside standard React out-of-the-box hooks to manage global state.

All API fetching is done with **Axios**.

API testing is done with **Postman**.

The IDE which the Dashboard team uses is **VSCode**, but any IDE will do for this project.

All version control is done through **Git**. We do it through command line, but there are many GUIs which can help you, like **GitKraken**.

We also recommend installing **MongoDB Compass** to help with database management.
