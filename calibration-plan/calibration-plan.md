# Calibration Plan

An overvies of how to calibrate the Buoy sensors in the field or lab.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We are using three main types of sensors reagrding calibration, analog sensors calibrated based on a k-value, sensors with built in EZO circuits that are claibrated by UART commands, and sensors taht do not need calibration.

This section will go over the calibration process for the six currently used sensors, which cover all three of these sensor calibration types.
