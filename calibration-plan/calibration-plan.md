# Calibration Plan

An overvies of how to calibrate the Buoy sensors in the field or lab.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We are using three main types of sensors reagrding calibration, analog sensors calibrated based on a k-value, sensors with built in EZO circuits that are claibrated by UART commands, and sensors that do not need calibration.

This section will cover the general calibration process for each of these types and the specific calibration process for the six currently used sensors.

This process will require various buffer solutions, a second Arduino Uno Board with a simple Serial program, and a device wit haccess to the online Dashboard.
