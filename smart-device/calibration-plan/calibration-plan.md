# Calibration Plan

An overvies of the current calibration plan for the May 2022 device deliverable. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Scope

This calibration plan is a temportacy solution due to time constarints. This plan shoudl be updated and improved to allow eisier field calibration.

The current plan is best performed is a lab setting, by a user with at least basic knwoledge of the code, with acess to all buffer solutions.

## Overview

This section will cover the calibration instructions for all six of the sensors currently being deployed.

Each subsection will provide the calibration instructions for a sensor in isolation, with the requried materials and the procduere to follow to calibrate it.

It is recommended that all calibration is performed on the same zero that will be deployed in the field for most accurate data.
