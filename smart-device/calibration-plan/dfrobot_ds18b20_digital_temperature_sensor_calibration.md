# DFRobot DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor Calibration

A walkthrough of the DFRobot DS18B20 digital temperature sensor calibration procedure.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This sensor is relatively accurate even without calibration. At this stage, there is no formal calibration process for this sensor.

It is recommended that a calibration process is added in the future.
