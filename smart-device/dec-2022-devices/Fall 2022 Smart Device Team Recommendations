# Fall 2022 Smart Device Team Recommendations

## Revert firmware to using C++ from C

We believe that project should revert to a C++ codebase. This is because:

- The sensor libraries from the manufacturer are written in C++ and widely used making it easier to implement sensors and reduces time spent debugging.
- Recreating existing communications protocols like modbus and I2C are incredibly demanding and difficult to debug

Overall we believe that making the swap will substantially cut down on development time, reduce bugs and increase readability of code.

This will make it easier for the project to transition to an open source model in the future as well.

## Ongoing Documentation

Thorough and ongoing documentation will help future teams onboard quicker and will also help with the transition to an open source model.

## Sensor Vetting

2 of the sensors slated for implementation this term had inherent performance flaws that made them inviable for the project.

We recommend a vetting process to determine if the senors are viable before being passed onto the smart device team for implementation.
