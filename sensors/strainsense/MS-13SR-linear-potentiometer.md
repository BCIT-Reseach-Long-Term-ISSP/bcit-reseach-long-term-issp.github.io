## Description

The MS-13SR (Spring Return) series of linear potentiometers are designed to withstand the harsh environments of motorsport, testing and industrial applications. Using proven ‘Conductive Plastic’ technology, the sensors offer high performance and reliability at operational temperatures up to +150°C 

The rugged, yet compact 13mm diameter MS-13SR is available with stroke lengths from 25mm up to 75mm, flange mount, a choice of potentiometer and regulated analogue outputs. 

Standard versions available – See MS-13 datasheet. 

Accessories available in our Accessory Datasheet such as, protective sleeve, body clamps etc.
