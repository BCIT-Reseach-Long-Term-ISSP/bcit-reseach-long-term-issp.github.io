# Smart Device Prototype 0.9

This is the first deployable prototype of the IoT based Water Quality Meter.

This device was designed to take water quality measurements and publish the data to the online Dashboard.

This device does not include a technician interface or MQTT Subscription support. As such, any changes must be made in the soruce code directly and re-flashed to the delployed device.

This prototype includes the device hardware, a fabricated enclosure and sensor floaty, and multiple power saving features.

This prototype has been deployed at Guichon Creek for testing over the summer of 2020.
