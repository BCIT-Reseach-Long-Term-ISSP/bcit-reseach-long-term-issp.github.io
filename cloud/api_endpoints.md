# API Endpoints
## Overview
An API endpoint in AWS serves as a specific URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that applications use to interact with a particular service or resource within the Amazon Web Services ecosystem. It acts as a gateway, allowing external applications to send requests and receive responses, enabling seamless communication and integration with AWS services.

## How it works
There are 2 API endpoints currently implemented for this project: https://c5hn9pagt5.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/device and https://c5hn9pagt5.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/user. Their work is further documented in the subsections of this page.
