# Project Purpose
The YVR EMA water monitoring stationâ€™s purpose is to monitor quality of water in channels that drain off the airport. Currently these measurements are being performed manually on a weekly basis. The proposed water monitoring station will collect various water parameters in an automated manor. The stations will enable high accuracy measurements and higher sampling rates reducing the labour and improving the quality of the data. The data is sent to the cloud and is combined with whether and tide data for data analytics.
